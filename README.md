# Resource

* GWAS (180 used in Choobdar et al. 2019 Nature Methods/the DREAM challenge paper) `/cellar/users/f6zheng/Data2/GWAS/4_gwas_datasets`
* GWAS (more based on [EBI-GWAS catalog](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/file-downloads)) `/cellar/users/ecdymore/GWAS_Context/Gene_by_Trait`

* BioGRID (abstracts associated with interactions), use papers generating >=5 interactions:`/cellar/users/f6zheng/Data2/text_mining/biogrid` 


# Plan

Fig. 1: Data, Method and Workflow  
Fig. 2: Show basic heterogeneous network, with STRING or humanNet; compare to homogeneous network (predict GWAS)  
Fig. 3: Show that interactions can be literature dependent. Some pleiotropic proteins interact with a lot of things but interactions are specific to particular biological topics  
Fig. 4: Use doc vectors as edge embedding to predict GWAS  
Fig. 5: Intepret predictions with attention
